##Rho Shoutouts Carousel

For this project, I took a JSON data file of kudos to-and-from classmates and created a Carousel application.

The application has two navigational buttons that display the current "selected" student.

The carousel of circles at the bottom of the page changes color to corresponds to each "selected" student.
